# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
# IMPORTANT: Unlike .gitignore, .gcloudignore explicitly INCLUDES patterns by default
# We need to include dist/ folders for deployment even though they're in .gitignore
